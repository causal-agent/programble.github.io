  volunteer:
    I’ve written many, and contributed to some,
    open-source projects on GitHub.
    For example,
    a friend and I
    created a Clojure-like Lisp
    with Ruby interoperation
    on the Rubinius VM.
    I’ve also made web API clients,
    stylesheets,
    development tools,
    data structure libraries,
    hobby operating systems,
    and many Befunge interpreters.
    I publish short technical articles
    on my website
    and have spent time helping others
    in Rust IRC channels.

  work:
    - title: Software Developer
      company: AdGear
      location: Montréal
      start: October 2015
      end: present
      doings:
        I designed and implemented a replacement
        for the primary ETL
        providing time-sensitive state
        to a global real-time bidding system.
        The design solved performance, correctness, and concurrency
        issues in the legacy system,
        and served as a strong example of Rust
        in the company.
        I vectorized a hash table implementation
        in a specialized key-value database service
        to take advantage of SIMD instruction sets
        and measured the performance increase
        with microbenchmarks.
        I set up fuzzing jobs
        for many Erlang NIFs written in C
        to try to find edge case crashes,
        which can bring down the BEAM.

    - title: Software Developer
      company: Busbud
      location: Montréal
      start: December 2013
      end: April 2015
      doings:
        I migrated geographic data
        from MongoDB to PostgreSQL,
        and replaced Elasticsearch
        with Postgres materialized views
        and trigram indexes.
        This centralized data
        and improved performance.
        I introduced promises and functional programming
        to the Node.js server,
        which facilitated writing organized, asynchronous code.
        I helped redesign the interfaces and data models
        for integrating partner APIs into Busbud’s,
        which were previously too restricted and lossy.

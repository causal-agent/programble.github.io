This is a simple approach
to unit testing in C
that I've used in a couple projects.
At the bottom of a C file
with some code I want to test,
I add:

	#ifdef TEST
	#include <assert.h>
	
	int main(void) {
		assert(...);
		assert(...);
	}
	
	#endif

This file normally produces a
*.o*
to be linked into the main binary.
For testing,
I produce separate binaries
and run them with
make(1):

	TESTS = foo.t bar.t
	
	.SUFFIXES: .t
	
	.c.t:
		$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -DTEST $(LDFLAGS) $< $(LDLIBS) -o $@
	
	test: $(TESTS)
		set -e; $(TESTS:%=./%;)

Note that the test binaries
aren't linked with the rest of the code,
so there is potential for simple stubbing or mocking.

To get the best output
from C's simple
assert(3),
it's best to assert the result
of a helper function
which takes the expected output
and the test input,
rather than calling
assert(3)
inside the helper function.
This way,
the message printed by the assert failure
contains a useful line number
and the expected output
rather than just variable names.

For a real example,
check
[term.c](https://code.causal.agency/june/catgirl/src/branch/master/term.c)
from my IRC client project.

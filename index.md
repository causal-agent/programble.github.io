Hi.
I'm Curtis,
a software developer
from Montr√©al.
I'm interested in
the intricacies of computing
and craftspersonship.

My hobby projects
can be found on [GitHub].
I'm currently using
[Rust] or C
for most of my projects.
I also collect [records].
A few of my favourite bands are
*Swans*,
*Xiu Xiu*,
*La Dispute*,
and *Godspeed You! Black Emperor*.

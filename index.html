      Hi. I'm Curtis. I am an 18-year-old aspiring software engineer near
      Montreal, Quebec.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently a student at <a href="http://dawsoncollege.qc.ca">Dawson
      College</a> in the Computer Science Technology program.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time I work on hobby software
      <a href="projects.html">projects</a>, which can be found on
      <a href="https://github.com/programble">GitHub</a> or
      <a href="https://bitbucket.org/programble">Bitbucket</a>. My preferred
      tools of the trade are Ruby, C, Clojure and JavaScript, and I do it all
      on Ubuntu.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I'm coding, I tend to be listening to music, which I scrobble to
      <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/programble">Last.fm</a>. Some of my
      favorite artists are <em>mewithoutYou</em>, <em>Godspeed You! Black
      Emperor</em>, <em>Neutral Milk Hotel</em> and <em>Arcade Fire</em>. I am
      also a collector of records.

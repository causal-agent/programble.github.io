Hi, I'm Curtis,
a software developer
from Montréal, Québec.
I work at [AdGear][adgear].

[adgear]: http://adgear.com

I'm interested
in building APIs
and working with relational databases,
as well as creating
development tooling.

I enjoy working on
hobby [projects](projects.html)
and contributing to open-source software
on [GitHub][github].
I'm currently interested in
working with [Rust][rust].

[github]: https://github.com/programble
[rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org

After software,
my main interest is (listening to) music.
I collect [records](records.html),
many from local post-rock groups such as
*Godspeed You! Black Emperor*
and *Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra*.
I've also recently been listening to
*Ought*,
*Swans*
and *Deafheaven*.

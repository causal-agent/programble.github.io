By the end of
[part Ⅰ][pt1],
the classic phrase,
"Hello, world!",
had appeared on screen
in beautiful bright green
and all was well.
It was, though,
not at all close
to being any sort of game.
To get closer to
being able to implement Tetris,
more I/O functions are necessary.
And in implementing these functions,
it will be useful to be able to debug them.

### Debugging

Assembly is just as easy to debug as C.
In fact, the same tools work for both.

As with C,
the first thing to do
is compile with debugging information.
The flag for NASM is the same as for GCC, `-g`.
It's also useful to set a flag
for conditional compilation with
`-d DEBUG`.
This can be tested in NASM
very similarly to C.

```nasm
%ifdef DEBUG
; ...
%endif
```

To have QEMU listen for a debugger,
use the `-s` flag.
To have it pause execution
until a debugger is attached
(and the `continue` command issued),
use the `-S` flag as well.

After starting GDB
with the path to the kernel binary,
it can be attached
to a listening QEMU instance with
`target remote localhost:1234`.
This command can be executed on start
with the `-ex` command-line option.
To have GDB output the current instruction
at each step,
use `display/i $pc`
and `set disassembly-flavor intel`.

Most GDB commands can be used as normal.
However,
there are alternate commands
to step by instruction:
`nexti` and `stepi`
(or `ni` and `si`).
Register values can be printed
with `p $eax`, for example.
Memory can be printed with `x`.

```
(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x101a00
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, 0x00101a00 in main ()
1: x/i $pc
=> 0x101a00 <main>:	push   0x20
(gdb) si
0x00101a02 in main ()
1: x/i $pc
=> 0x101a02 <main+2>:	call   0x101d97 <clear>
(gdb) p $esp
$1 = (void *) 0x1040fc
(gdb) x $esp
0x1040fc:	0x00000020
```

### Number formatting

The `puts` function from last time
puts strings on the screen,
but provides no way
to print numbers.
The traditional name for a function
that formats numbers as strings
is `itoa`.

The function will take a double-word number
and a word containing
the radix in the upper byte
and the desired width in the lower byte.
It will return a pointer
into a static string buffer.
Since the game will be single-threaded,
a static buffer works fine here.

Since the longest possible output
is a 32-bit double-word formatted as binary,
the static buffer needs to be 32 bytes long
with a null-terminator.

The function will also need a list
of digit characters to use.

```nasm
section .data
output db '00000000000000000000000000000000', 0
digits db '0123456789ABCDEF'
```

The implementation will be using
all of the callee-saved registers,[^1]
so its prologue and epilogue look like this.

```nasm
section .text
itoa:
  push ebp
  mov ebp, esp
  push ebx
  push esi
  push edi

  pop edi
  pop esi
  pop ebx
  mov esp, ebp
  pop ebp
  ret
```

#### Algorithm

The algorithm for formatting numbers
is the same as for converting numbers between radixes.

1. Divide the number by the radix
2. The remainder is the next digit, starting from the least significant
3. Repeat with the quotient until it is zero

For example,
the remainders from dividing 26 by 2
give its binary representation,
11010.

1. 26 = 2 &times; 13 + 0
2. 13 = 2 &times; 6 + 1
3. 6 = 2 &times; 3 + 0
4. 3 = 2 &times; 1 + 1
5. 1 = 2 &times; 0 + 1

To use this to format numbers,
the remainders will be used
as offsets into the list of digit characters.
Additionally,
since `itoa` takes a width,
it will simply loop that number of times,
rather than stopping at a quotient of zero.

#### Implementation

Since the digits are calculated least-significant first,
`itoa` needs to start at the end of the string buffer.
To work backwards using string operations,
it uses the `std` instruction.[^2]

```nasm
lea edi, [output + 32]
std
```

Next, the number is loaded into `eax` and the base into `ebx`.
The width is loaded into `ecx` for use with `loop`.[^3]

```nasm
mov eax, [ebp + 8]
movzx ebx, byte [ebp + 13]
movzx ecx, byte [ebp + 12]
```

The loop itself first clears `edx` on each iteration,
since 32-bit division treats it as the high bits of the dividend.
It then divides,
indexes into the digit characters,
and writes to the buffer.
The quotient remains in `eax`
for further division.

```nasm
.loop:
  xor edx, edx
  div ebx
  lea esi, [digits + edx]
  movsb
  loop .loop
```

At the end of this loop,
`edi` has actually been decremented
one too many times,
so one is added
when setting `eax`,
the return value.
According to the calling convention,
the direction flag is also reset
with `cld`.

```nasm
lea eax, [edi + 1]
cld
```

#### Hello, numbers

Now that `itoa` is implemented,
it can be combined with `puts`
to print numbers.

```nasm
main:
  push word BG.BLACK | ' '
  call clear

  push word 0x0208
  push dword 26
  call itoa

  push dword 0x0101 << 16 | FG.BRIGHT | FG.GREEN
  push eax
  call puts

  add esp, 16
  jmp halt
```

Way better than "Hello, world!", right?

### Keyboard input

That covers the O of "I/O,"
now for the I.
There are two ways to read keyboard input on x86:
with interrupts
and through polling.
Interrupts are complicated to set up,
and they aren't needed[^4]
for this particular case,
so polling will be used.

Keyboard input comes in the form
of byte-sized "scancodes."
There are key-down and key-up scancodes
for each key,
which are read
from port `0x60`.
To be useful,
the `scan` function
will keep track
of the previously read scancode
to detect when it changes.

```nasm
section .data
key db 0
```

Since the function won't be taking any parameters,
it doesn't need a prologue or epilogue.
It will, however,
start by zeroing `eax`,
since it will set only `al`
for its return value.

```nasm
section .text
scan:
  xor eax, eax
```

Then,
the current scancode is read
and compared to the previous code.
If the scancode has not changed,
zero is returned.
Otherwise,
the previous scancode is updated
and returned.

```nasm
in al, 0x60
cmp al, [key]
je .zero
mov [key], al
ret

.zero:
  xor al, al
  ret
```

[^4]: Stay tuned for the absolutely terrible way in which timing can be
      achieved without interrupts!

#### Input loop

Putting everything together,
an input loop can
show the last scancode
on the screen.
This is useful
finding scancodes of new keys.

```nasm
main:
  push BG.BLACK | ' '
  call clear
  add esp, 2

  .loop:
    call scan
    test al, al
    jz .loop

    push word 0x0A02
    push eax
    call itoa
    push dword 0x0101 << 16 | FG.BRIGHT | FG.GREEN
    push eax
    call puts
    add esp, 16

    jmp .loop
```

This is what holding the left shift key looks like.

[![Input loop QEMU screenshot][key]][key]

To reset using the keyboard,
the returned scancode can be compared
to the R key-down scancode, `0x13`.

```nasm
call scan
test al, al
jz .loop

cmp al, 0x13
je reset
```

### Next time...

Speaking of *time*,
the next set of basic functions
to implement will be for timing.
After that,
it should be possible
to start making the actual game.

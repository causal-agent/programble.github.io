      Hi. I'm Curtis. I am <span id="a">an</span>
      <span id="age">18</span>-year-old software engineer near Montreal,
      Quebec.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      I am currently a web developer at
      <a href="http://www.busbud.com">Busbud</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time I work on hobby software
      <a href="projects.html">projects</a>, which can be found on
      <a href="https://github.com/programble">GitHub</a> or
      <a href="https://bitbucket.org/programble">Bitbucket</a>. My preferred
      tools of the trade are Ruby, C, Clojure and JavaScript, and I do it all
      on Ubuntu.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I'm coding, I tend to be listening to music, which I scrobble to
      <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/programble">Last.fm</a>. Some of my
      favorite artists are <em>mewithoutYou</em>, <em>Godspeed You! Black
      Emperor</em>, <em>Neutral Milk Hotel</em> and <em>Arcade Fire</em>. I am
      also a collector of records.

Hi, I'm Curtis.
I am a 20-year-old
software developer
from Montréal, Québec.
</p>

I'm interested
in building web APIs
and working with relational databases,
as well as creating tools
for developers.

I enjoy working on
hobby [projects](projects.html)
and contributing to open-source software.
All of my personal work
can be found on [GitHub][github].
These days I'm mostly working with
Node.js or C
on OS X or Arch Linux.

My main interest
after software development
is (listening to) music.
I collect [records][discogs] ([for nerds][records]),
mainly consisting of local post-rock,
such as
*Godspeed You! Black Emperor*
and *Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra*.
Some of my other
favourite artists include
*Swans*,
*mewithoutYou*,
and *Neutral Milk Hotel*.

title: Résumé

I'm interested in
learning the intricate details of systems
and building well-crafted tools.
I want to make software that works.

Here are some of the technologies
I've enjoyed working with:

- C, make, mdoc, zlib, curses
- Rust, Protobuf, American Fuzzy Lop
- Ruby, TypeScript/JavaScript, PostgreSQL, SQLite
- FreeBSD, NetBSD, macOS, Arch Linux

#### Funemployed at home, August 2017 –

Away from work,
I focused on creativity and communication.
I created a collaborative ASCII art project
as a public SSH service.
I started a terminal IRC client
and worked on easy but significant UX improvements.
I designed a colour scheme,
wrote a PNG optimizer,
a bitmap font editor
and a syntax highlighter.

#### Software developer at Hopper, May 2017 – August 2017

I learned a little bit of
Scala,
HBase
and Elasticsearch.
I didn't stay long
due to lasting
negative mental health effects
of my previous job.

#### Software developer at AdGear, October 2015 – April 2017

I designed and implemented a replacement
for the primary ETL
providing time-sensitive state
to a real-time bidding system.
The design solved
performance, correctness and concurrency
issues in the legacy system.
I vectorized a hash table implementation
in a specialized key-value store
to take advantage of SIMD.
I set up fuzzing jobs
for many Erlang NIFs written in C,
for which crashes can bring down the BEAM.
I also designed schemas
and database constraints
to ensure data integrity.

#### Software developer at Busbud, December 2013 – April 2015

I migrated geographic data
from CouchDB to PostgreSQL,
and replaced Elasticsearch
with Postgres materialized views
and trigram indexes.
This centralized data
and improved performance.
I introduced promises and functional programming
to the Node.js server,
which facilitated writing organized, asynchronous code.
I helped redesign the interfaces and data models
for integrating partner APIs into Busbud’s,
which were previously too restricted and lossy.

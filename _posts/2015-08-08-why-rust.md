title: Why Rust Appeals to Me
---

I started coding in [Rust][rust] this week,
and although the language is very young,
I was quickly impressed
with how much it does right.

[rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org

This is a list of
aspects of Rust
I've been impressed with
over the past week.
I won't bother listing
the language's main selling points,
as they're already listed on the website.
I'm also sure
many lists like this
exist already,
but I'd like to have something
I can point to
for my own reasons
to like Rust.

I'll also add,
as a bit of background,
that I was previously coding in
Node.js and TypeScript (among others).

- Easy to [install][install]
- Easy to [uninstall][uninstall] (so very rare in the UNIX world)
- Reasonable [Hello, World!][hello]
- Official build tool / package manager, [Cargo][cargo]
  - Low barrier to start a new project, `cargo new`
  - Single step build & run, `cargo run`
  - Infers author information from git configuration
- Excellent [standard library documentation][stddoc]
- [Algebraic][enums] data types!
- [Pattern][patterns] matching and [destructuring][destructuring]
- [Tuples][tuples]
- [Iterators][iterators]
- Unicode [char][char] and [String][strings]
- [Immutable][mutability] by default
- Implicit return / expressions
- Hygienic [macros][macros]
- FFI examples for Ruby, Python and Node.js in the [book][ffi]
- Simple [C FFI][cffi]
- Built-in Markdown [documentation][documentation] generation (`cargo doc`)
- Built-in [test][testing] runner (`cargo test`)
  - In-module unit tests
  - [Documentation tests][doctests] (examples from documentation are run as
    tests)
  - Separate integration tests
  - Easy [Travis][travis] setup
- Usable random, from the [rand crate][rand] (this is apparently really hard
  for systems languages)

I think that
the overall
most appealing aspect of Rust
for me
is that it's a systems language
that doesn't feel like a systems language.
Using it
feels so much more comfortable
than writing C or C++.

title: Résumé

I'm interested in
learning more systems programming
and really getting into
the details of things.
I have a passion for
well-crafted tools
and making computers suck less.

Here are some of the technologies
I've enjoyed working with:

- Rust, C, x86 assembly, Ruby, TypeScript/JavaScript
- PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis
- FreeBSD, macOS, Arch Linux
- Protobuf, American Fuzzy Lop, ncurses, zlib

I write a lot of code
because I enjoy solving problems
and learning how to do things myself.
I've made web API clients,
stylesheets,
development tools,
data structure libraries,
hobby operating systems,
and too many Befunge interpreters.
I try to help out
in Rust IRC channels
and sometimes write
for my technical blog.
My posts have even been on Hacker News twice,
so you could say I'm kind of a big deal.

#### Funemployed at home, August 2017 –

Away from work,
I tried to focus on creativity.
I created a public, collaborative ASCII art SSH service
using memory-mapped files, local sockets and ncurses.
I wrote an interactive graphics data explorer
with framebuffer, X11 and Cocoa interfaces.
Along with that,
I wrote a PNG encoder
and used bugs in my own code
to create interesting images.

#### Software developer at Hopper, May 2017 – August 2017

I learned a little
Scala,
HBase
and Elasticsearch.
I couldn't stay long
due to burnout
from my previous job.

#### Software developer at AdGear, October 2015 – April 2017

I designed and implemented a replacement
for the primary ETL
providing time-sensitive state
to a global real-time bidding system.
The design solved performance, correctness, and concurrency
issues in the legacy system,
and served as a strong example of Rust
in the company.
I vectorized a hash table implementation
in a specialized key-value database service
to take advantage of SIMD instruction sets
and measured the performance increase
with microbenchmarks.
I set up fuzzing jobs
for many Erlang NIFs written in C
to try to find edge case crashes,
which can bring down the BEAM.

#### Software developer at Busbud, December 2013 – April 2015

I migrated geographic data
from CouchDB to PostgreSQL,
and replaced Elasticsearch
with Postgres materialized views
and trigram indexes.
This centralized data
and improved performance.
I introduced promises and functional programming
to the Node.js server,
which facilitated writing organized, asynchronous code.
I helped redesign the interfaces and data models
for integrating partner APIs into Busbud’s,
which were previously too restricted and lossy.

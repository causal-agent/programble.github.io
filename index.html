      Hi, I'm Curtis. I am <span id="a">a</span>
      <span id="age">19</span>-year-old software engineer from Montreal,
      Quebec.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a web developer at <a href="http://www.busbud.com">Busbud</a>, an
      online bus travel startup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I also enjoy coding hobby
      <a href="projects.html">projects</a> and contributing to open-source
      software. My projects and contributions can be found on
      <a href="https://github.com/programble">GitHub</a>. I work on Ubuntu and
      mostly write JavaScript, Ruby or C.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other than software, I'm interested in music and collecting records. My
      collection mostly consists of local post-rock, including <em>Godspeed
      You! Black Emperor</em> and <em>Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial
      Orchestra</em>. Some of my other favourite artists are
      <em>mewithoutYou</em>, <em>Arcade Fire</em> and <em>Neutral Milk Hotel</em>.

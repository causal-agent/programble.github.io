title: Résumé

I'm interested in
learning the intricate details of systems
and building well-crafted tools.
I want to make software that works.

Here are some of the technologies
I've enjoyed working with:

- C, make, mdoc, zlib, curses
- Rust, Protobuf, American Fuzzy Lop
- Ruby, TypeScript/JavaScript, PostgreSQL, SQLite
- FreeBSD, NetBSD, macOS, Arch Linux

I write code
because I enjoy solving problems
and learning how to do things myself.
I've worked on web API clients,
stylesheets,
development tools,
data structures,
hobby operating systems
and creative projects.
For some time
I helped out
in Rust IRC channels,
which was helpful for my own learning.
I also try to write
about new things I've learned
on my technical blog.

#### Funemployed at home, August 2017 –

Away from work,
I tried to focus on creativity
and communication.
I created a public collaborative ASCII art project
as an SSH service using
memory-mapped files,
local sockets
and curses.
I started a terminal IRC client,
also available over SSH,
where I focused on improved UX.
I wrote a PNG encoder and optimizer,
and used bugs in my code
to create visually interesting "glitch" images.
I designed my own terminal colour scheme
and programmed a bitmap font editor.

#### Software developer at Hopper, May 2017 – August 2017

I learned a little bit of
Scala,
HBase
and Elasticsearch.
I didn't stay long
due to lasting
negative mental health effects
of my previous job.

#### Software developer at AdGear, October 2015 – April 2017

I designed and implemented a replacement
for the primary ETL
providing time-sensitive state
to a global real-time bidding system.
The design solved performance, correctness, and concurrency
issues in the legacy system,
and served as a strong example of Rust
in the company.
I vectorized a hash table implementation
in a specialized key-value database service
to take advantage of SIMD instruction sets
and measured the performance increase
with microbenchmarks.
I set up fuzzing jobs
for many Erlang NIFs written in C
to try to find edge case crashes,
which can bring down the BEAM.

#### Software developer at Busbud, December 2013 – April 2015

I migrated geographic data
from CouchDB to PostgreSQL,
and replaced Elasticsearch
with Postgres materialized views
and trigram indexes.
This centralized data
and improved performance.
I introduced promises and functional programming
to the Node.js server,
which facilitated writing organized, asynchronous code.
I helped redesign the interfaces and data models
for integrating partner APIs into Busbud’s,
which were previously too restricted and lossy.

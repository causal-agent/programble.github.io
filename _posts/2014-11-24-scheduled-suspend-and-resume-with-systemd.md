title: Scheduled Suspend and Resume With systemd
---

I recently replaced my main computer with a MacBook Pro and found myself
with a spare [Lenovo IdeaPad U410][u410]. Having a 32GB SSD and a 500GB
HDD, I decided to set it up as a file server on my LAN.

This was all well and good, but having an always-on Intel i5 serving
files I'm only likely to access during a handful of hours in the day
seemed incredibly wasteful. I figured the server would only need to be
on during the evenings when I'm at home, and suspended the rest of the
time. I set out to automate this.

### Ignoring Lid Close

The first step to automating the suspend/resume cycle is something I had
already configured earlier, which is disabling automatic suspend when
the lid is closed. Kind of important for a laptop server.

The way to do this with [systemd][systemd] (the init system we all know and
love) is in `/etc/systemd/logind.conf`:

```ini
HandleLidSwitch=ignore
```

In order for this change to take effect, the `logind` service must be
restarted:

```sh
systemctl restart systemd-logind
```

More information on power management with systemd can be found on the
[Arch Linux Wiki][archpm].

### systemd Timers

systemd has a [timer system][timers] that can be used to invoke systemd
services similarly to cron. The `OnCalendar` option of timers can be
used to trigger a timer at certain times according to a [calendar event
rule][events].

 [events]: http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.time.html#Calendar%20Events

#### Suspend

In my case, I wanted to have my server suspend itself every day at 3 AM
(I'm usually in bed by this time). To do this, I created
`/etc/systemd/system/auto-suspend.timer`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Automatically suspend on a schedule

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 03:00:00

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

By default, a timer will invoke a service by the same name when
triggered, so I created `/etc/systemd/system/auto-suspend.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Suspend

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/systemctl suspend
```

The service simply runs the systemd command to suspend the computer. I
imagine there might be a better way to do it, but this way works fine.

#### Resume

Another handy feature of systemd timers is the ability to wake the
system when triggered, with the `WakeSystem` option. I wanted my server
to resume at 6:30 PM, around the time I usually get home, so I created
`/etc/systemd/system/auto-resume.timer`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Automatically resume on a schedule

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 18:30:00
WakeSystem=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

This should do it, but the timer still wants to invoke a service, so I
created a no-op in `/etc/systemd/system/auto-resume.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Does nothing

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/true
```

Once again, there is likely a better way to achieve this, but I am no
systemd expert.

(Added 2014-11-25) It was brought to my attention that unitless wake
timers were suggested [here][unitless-mail], and were added to the
"TODO" file [here][unitless-commit]. Thanks to Alexandre Detiste for the
information.

#### Make it Go

To turn these timers on, enable and start them:

```sh
systemctl enable auto-suspend.timer
systemctl start auto-suspend.timer

systemctl enable auto-resume.timer
systemctl start auto-resume.timer
```

Now my Lenovo sits on a shelf with the lid closed, only fully powered on
and serving files for 8.5 hours of the day instead of 24.

### Caveats

I haven't quite figured out how to change the suspend/resume schedule on
weekends, when I spend more time at home. I'm sure I just need to read a
bit more on [systemd Calendar Events][events], but it's not the weekend
yet, so I'll worry about it later.

*Update 2015-05-31:*

To have different schedules on weekends and weekdays, I created two `.timer`
files with `WakeSystem=true`, and prefixed the `OnCalendar` value of one with
`Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri`, and the other with `Sat,Sun`. The same can be done for
suspend. For the timers with different names, specify the unit it should invoke
with `Unit=auto-resume.service`, for example. Remember to enable and start all
timers.

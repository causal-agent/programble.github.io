Hi.
I'm Curtis,
a software developer
from Montréal, Québec.

I'm interested
in systems programming,
databases,
and creating well-crafted tools.

I enjoy working on
hobby [projects](projects.html)
and contributing to open-source software
on [GitHub].
I'm currently interested in
working with [Rust].

[GitHub]: https://github.com/programble
[Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org

After software,
my main interest is (listening to) music.
I collect [records](records.html),
many from local post-rock groups such as
*Godspeed You! Black Emperor*
and *Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra*.
I've also recently been listening to
*Death Grips*,
*Swans*,
and *Xiu Xiu*.
